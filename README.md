# ClimateWins
This repository includes Python scripts in Jupyter Notebooks and two presentations with machine learning assessments and recommendations.


## Project Context

CimateWins is a European nonprofit interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world. This project assesses some machine learning tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe.

## Key Questions

- How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
- Are there any ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI specific to this project?
- Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
- Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day?

## Data

Weather data set came from the [European Climate Assessment and Data Set Project](https://www.ecad.eu). Corresponding pleasant weather data was supplied by CareerFoundry.

## Files

The project files contain the following:

- Scripts: Jupyter notebooks containing code for analysis and algorithms
- Project briefs: Objectives, company profile, and project details
- Presentations: Interim report and final presentation with recommendations on algorithms to use for future analysis
